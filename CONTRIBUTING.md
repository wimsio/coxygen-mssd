Here’s a set of **numbered** community guidelines you can include in your GitHub repo (e.g. in a `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`):

1. **Respect and Kindness**  
   Promote respectful communication, avoid personal attacks, and engage in constructive dialogue at all times.

2. **Inclusivity and Tolerance**  
   Welcome diverse perspectives and foster an environment where everyone—regardless of background, identity, or experience—feels valued.

3. **Following Rules**  
   Adhere to any additional rules or regulations specific to this repository (e.g. issue templates, contribution guidelines, licensing).

4. **Accuracy and Honesty**  
   Share information that is accurate and credible. Do your best to verify facts and avoid spreading misinformation.

5. **Productivity and Contribution**  
   Actively participate: report issues clearly, submit thoughtful pull requests, review others’ contributions, and help newcomers get started.

6. **Avoiding Harassment and Discrimination**  
   Any form of harassment, discrimination, or bullying (including hateful language, slurs, or intimidation) is strictly prohibited.

7. **Respect for Intellectual Property**  
   Cite and respect the work of others. Do not post code, designs, or media you do not have the right to share.

8. **Responsible Use of Technology**  
   Use the platform responsibly—no spam, malware, or disruptive activities. Keep discussions on-topic and relevant to the project.
